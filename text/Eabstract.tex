This paper details the development, design, and utility of "ARShowNode" and "ARShow," presentation systems that integrate 3D models with QR codes to achieve advanced visualization in Augmented Reality (AR) space via Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). While AR technology is currently utilized in diverse fields such as education, marketing, and entertainment, achieving a high level of balance between accessibility and interactivity remains a challenge. This study proposes a bidirectional platform comprising the "ARShowNode" project for creators and the "ARShow" project for viewers, and discusses the technical specifications based on the Unity engine, asset upload and download mechanisms, and the 3D model visualization process.

Previous research, such as "AR MUSE," presented inexpensive and user-friendly solutions associating 3D models with QR codes using Android devices. In contrast, the novelty of this research lies in the implementation of a hot-update mechanism for exhibitions utilizing HMDs, which provide a highly immersive experience. This capability enables the fine-tuning of behaviors and the immediate updating of exhibition content without requiring application rebuilds or store review processes.

Regarding system evaluation, a protocol was established to conduct subject experiments targeting creators with Unity development experience and general viewers, utilizing quantitative and qualitative questionnaires to assess the system from the perspective of system usability.
